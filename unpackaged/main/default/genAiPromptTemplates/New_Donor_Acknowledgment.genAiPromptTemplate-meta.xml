        <content>I am a gift officer at this nonprofit organization. The audience is a new donor. 

I want to generate an acknowledgment letter for this new donor&#39;s gift to my organization. This letter should be no more than 3 paragraphs long and no more than 350 words. The language should be concise, professional, and gracious. The donor should feel appreciated and welcomed for making their first gift. 

In the first paragraph, we need to reference the CLOSE DATE, AMOUNT and GIVING VEHICLE and reference the fact that they&#39;re a new donor.

In the second paragraph, we need to include information about the CAMPAIGN and DESIGNATION they donated to to thank them for their contribution.

In the closing paragraph, we need to thank the donor again and direct them to review our annual report at ANNUAL REPORT and our website at WEBSITE.

If they give a gift that is over AMOUNT, then they are considered a major donor. Adjust the language overall to highlight how generous and impactful their donation will. Don&#39;t be too effusive.
